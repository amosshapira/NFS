This is a puppet module for installing, configuring and starting the NFS and Autofs Daemons (http://nfs.sourceforge.net) (http://www.autofs.org).

NOTE: This module was mainly tested on RHEL/CentOS 5.x & 6.x using puppet 2.6.x and puppet 2.7.x

* Requirements:
	- Clear understanding of how to configure NFS ,Autofs and how each are configured.
	- puppet ( 2.6+ recommended) installed on all servers

Usage:
1. The following varibles are used in the following manner.

A. NFS Clients
 	Varibles defined the the file auto.master.

        	$am_mountpath,
        	$amfs_filepath,
        	$time_out,

	Varibles define in the file auto.x file which specifies the mount point.

        	$perms,
        	$nfss_erverhostname,
       		$autofilename,
        	$nfss_mountpath





2. Run puppet on the rest of the nodes

Example usage:

node 'puppet' {
        include nfs::server
                nfs::server::config {'testentry':
                        exportpath    => '/tmp',
                        ipallowed     => '192.0.0.0/255.255.255.0',
                        perms         => 'rw,sync,no_root_squash,insecure'
                }

                nfs::server::config {'testentry2':
                        exportpath    => '/opt',
                        ipallowed     => '192.0.0.0/255.255.255.0',
                        perms         => 'rw,sync,no_root_squash,insecure'

                }


        include nfs::client
                nfs::client::config {'magictmp':
                        am_mountpath       =>"/-",
                        autofilename      => 'magic',
                        time_out          => '60',
                        amfs_filepath        => 'auto.magic',
                        nfss_mountpath     => '/tmp',
                        perms             =>'/magic -rw,soft,rsize=8192,wsize=8192',
                        nfs_serverhostname => '192.168.159.128',
                }

}
